# Python Programming Challenges

This document outlines a series of Python programming challenges, each designed to test different aspects of your coding skills, from string manipulation and number theory to game development and data validation.

## 1. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

**Objective:** Given a string, find the longest substring that does not contain any repeating characters.

**Example:**
- Input: "abcabcbb"
- Output: "abc"

## 2. Prime Numbers List

**Objective:** Print a list of prime numbers up to a given number.

**Example:**
- Input: 10
- Output: [2, 3, 5, 7]

## 3. Top 10 Players

**Objective:** Given a list of players with their scores, sort the list and print the names of the top 10 players.

**Example:**
- Input: [("Alice", 10), ("Bob", 15), ...]
- Output: ["Bob", "Alice", ...]

## 4. Cow and Bull Game

**Objective:** Develop an application to play the Cow and Bull game, similar to the Wordle game by The New York Times. Maintain the score as well.

**Gameplay:**
- The game selects a secret word, and the player guesses the word.
- "Cows" indicates letters in the guessed word that are in the secret word but in the wrong position.
- "Bulls" indicates letters in the guessed word that are in the correct position.

## 5. Credit Card Validation (Luhn Check Algorithm)

**Objective:** Implement the Luhn algorithm to validate a given credit card number.

**Example:**
- Input: 12345678903555
- Output: Valid or Invalid

Each of these challenges requires a unique approach and understanding of Python programming concepts. Good luck!
