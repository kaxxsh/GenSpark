# Wordle Game

Wordle is a word puzzle game where players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word. After each guess, feedback is provided on which letters are correct and in the correct position (green), correct but in the wrong position (yellow), or not in the word at all (gray).

This project implements a web-based version of the Wordle game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
